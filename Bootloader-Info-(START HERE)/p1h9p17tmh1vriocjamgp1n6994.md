READ CLOSELY This isn't a hard process but it does require attention to
detail!

**(NOTE: This is for a Trigorilla V 0.0.2 board, make sure you have this
board beforehand.)**

I assume you know how to take apart your Chiron, but in case you don't
do as follows

-   Unplug it, slide the gantry all the way to the left and place it on
    its left side.

-   ![](./image1.png){width="3.9555555555555557in"
    height="5.091666666666667in"}Unscrew all the screws from the
    underside of the Chiron seen below

-   ![](./image12.jpeg){width="7.032638888888889in"
    height="4.356944444444444in"}Locate the jumper next to the USB port
    and move it the side that says USB, also check to see if your board
    says V 0.0.2. If not, I cannot guarantee this will work for you.
